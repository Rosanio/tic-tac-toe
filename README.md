# Tic Tac Toe Project

#### By Tyler Suderman and Matt Rosanio

## Description

The application is a fully functional board that uses alerts to show when a player has won and when there is a tie. There's also an alert when a player clicks on a field which has already been played. CSS styling could be revamped, jQuery needs refactoring. We're happy to have completed the functionality of the project, but a number of solutions yielded cumbersome and ineloquent code. Refactoring would certainly yield a more beautiful back-end ;).

##Setup

clone github repo and run index.html in web browser

## Tech Used

jQuery, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Mocha and Chai, Bootstrap
